## Background and Objectives

This course is an introduction to programming in R but with an emphasis
on covering some very important applications in applied economic and
financial research. It is assumed that, by this point, the student has a
working knowledge of statistics and econometrics. If time allows it, we
will also cover some useful topics on Octave (a free version of MATLAB,
basically Dynare, a package that we will use to solve, simulate and
present results for Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Models
-DSGEM-).

I will try to mimic real-world situations, were you are presented with
an open question and there is no immediate, evident way to solve it.
This is less comfortable way of learning than being given a list of
tasks to perform, but it is intended to prepare you to face situations I
have found myself in many times. As an advice, start working on the
problems as soon as possible.

This is a very fast paced course, so it is essential to attend lectures
regularly and keep-up with the material. As expected, you will have to
do a lot of programming but will also have to review a lot of reference
material, so try to stay focused from day one.

## Course materials

All course materials are freely available on the internet, and I will
send them to you or will forward you to them as appropriate. (I base
most of my presentations from this material).

We will base this course mainly off three different sources.

-   For the first part, we will use âAn Introduction to R, Notes on R: A
    Programming Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics, Version
    4.1.2â by Venables, Smith and the R core team.

-   For the second part, we will use âR for Data Science. Import, Tidy,
    Transform, Visualize and Model Dataâ by Wickham and Grolemund.

-   Lastly, we will use âTime Series Analysis and Its Applications, With
    R Examplesâ by Shumway and Stoffer.

For other topics, I will provide lecture notes.

## Communication.

All communication should be handed by mail. This includes turning up
your homework and projects.

When writing an email, please include âPES P2, *Subject*â in the subject
line (e.g.Â PES P2, Homework 1).

Also, please donât forget to mention and copy to each person sending the
mail.

When turning up your homework and projects, please consider sending
times, as deadlines refer to the time I receive the mails.

If you would like me to set up office hours (for specific questions),
please write a mail to me as I will not do so otherwise.

## Software.

We will use R (available [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)) and
RStudio (available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/))
extensively in this course. You should download and install the most
recent versions right away. We will also use a number of packages that
you will have to download and install as we progress in the course.

If time permits, we will use Octave for the last session, freely
available [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index).

## Grading.

There are two components for your grading: homework (40%), and two
projects (60%, 30% each).

The two projects are due on Sunday, January 29<sup>th</sup> and
Thursday, February 3<sup>rd</sup>, both before midnight.
